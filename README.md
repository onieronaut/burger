# Eat Dat Burger

A Node.js Express MySQL Handlebars application created during UCF's Web Development Bootcamp. Eat Dat Burger is a simple app that allows you to create a list of burgers, which are stored in a database. Users are then able to "devour" the burgers, which are then untouchable and stored in a different field.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the repository [here](https://github.com/onieronaut/burger)

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)

### Installation

After downloading the repository and installing Node.js, use your command line interface to navigate to the directory the repository is located in and install the required packages with:

    npm install

Using MySQL Workbench, execute the code in the `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` files to create your database.

## Usage

Once you have installed express you can create the server on your command line. Navigate to the root directory of the repository and in your command line input:

    node server.js

You should get a response saying App listening on PORT: 8080. To view your front end website now visit http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
